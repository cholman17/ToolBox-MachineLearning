Questions -- Toolbox for Machine Learning

What is the general trend in the curve?
	It's pretty linear and positively correlated with training percentage. The larger the training portion, the better the test accuracy.

Are there parts of the curve that appear to be noisier than others?  Why?
	I've found that it's noisier near the bottom of the curve, most likely because the training values are less, making less accurate tests.

How many trials do you need to get a smooth curve?
	I didn't start getting a "smooth" curve until num_trials = 30 or higher.

Try different values for C (by changing LogisticRegression(C=10**-10)).  What happens?
